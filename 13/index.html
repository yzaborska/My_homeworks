                    <p>
                        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
                        If you&apos;re looking for environment setup instructions, they've 
                        moved to <span class="underline-text"> their own section</span>.

                        Native Components, React, and more!

                    <p>
                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and 
                        iOS applications using React and the app platform&apos;s native capabiles. 
                        With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform&apos;s APIs 
                        as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using 
                        React components: <span class="italic-text">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. 
                        You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let&apos;s cover 
                        how components work in React Native.

                    <h2>React fundamentals<sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        React Native runs on <span class="underline-text">React</span>, 
                        a popular open source library for building user interfaces with 
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand 
                        React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as 
                        a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p><span class="bold-text">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction 
                        to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures 
                        that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold-text">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax 
                        that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="gray-bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, 
                        I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The React docs have <span class="underline-text">a comprehensive guide 
                        to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, 
                        you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="gray-bg">name</span>
                        for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces 
                        inside <span class="gray-bg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold-text">+ props.</span> Props is short for &ldquo;properties&rdquo;.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold-text">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments 
                        you use to configure how components render, state is like a component&apos;s 
                        personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over 
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your 
                        components memory!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter 
                        text. It has an <span class="italic-text">onChangeText</span> prop that takes 
                        a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing 
                        prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, let&apos;s say that as the user types, you&apos;re 
                        translating their words into a different language. 
                        In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 
                        <span class="pizza">üçï</span>. 
                        So the sentence &ldquo;Hello there Bob&rdquo; would be translated 
                        as <span class="pizza">&ldquo;üçï üçï&rdquo;</span>.
